We have java based applications

6. Deploy the artifacts in application server that is apache tomcat
7. Start the processes 
8. Post release check - testing. We are using selenium for testing
also 
We have java based microservices, we dockerize those applications by creating custom docker images.
Deploy it into different different envâ€¦
we have QA, Staging, PROD and UAT enviornments.

We push those images to our docker registry. we are using AWS-ECR(Elastic Container Registry) as a docker registry. 
We pull those emages in different envs and execute using docker run command.

Docker is a containerization tool. we can comapre it with VM. but containers are light weight. resourse utilization is good.
